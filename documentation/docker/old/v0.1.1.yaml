  description: API description for the VDX Booking interface which allow for scheduling of video meetings. <br> <br> Version 0.1 does not have a complete list of response codes for errors. <br> <br> <b>Versions:</b> <br> 0.1.1 >> <br>
    - changed format for provisionVmrId property on update-scheduling-info request to uuid format <br>
    - added meeting put and delete request <br>
    - removed "api" from each request path <br>
    - renamed ccsid to uuid (as the real API already are using) <br>
    - moved uuid path parameter to "component" part of format to allow for reuse (no functional impact) <br>
    - added response codes for each request <br>
    - only a 'provioner' can run a 'put scheduling-info' request <br>
  version: "0.1.1"
